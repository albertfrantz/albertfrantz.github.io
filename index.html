							<h1>Hi, I'm Albert</h1>
							<p class="major">
								<br>
								I am a recent graduate with a degree in economics. While completing my degree I discovered my passion for using data to answer complex questions. By taking econometric and statistic courses, I found that data provided the most convincing and objective answers to questions that in the past I could only approach through biased methods. I now understand that data can be convincingly used to solve almost any question that may be raised. This realization has made me excited about the possibility of using data to solve not only my own questions but also questions that businesses may raise to more optimize their practices. I am keen on pursuing a career in data and continuing to educate myself and expand my knowledge in the field.

								<h2>Bikes and Business:
									Identifying the Relationship Between Bike Lanes and New Business Creation in New York City
								</h2>
								<p>By using a difference in difference model, this study investigates how the installation of bike lanes affects new business creation in New York City for the years
									2010 and 2018. In carrying out this research, the results can help square the discussion of how bike infrastructure affects business health.
									Additionally, this research can assist cities in better deciding where to target new bike lane creation, as cities continue to solve congestion-related issues.

								<h2>Creating a Successful
									Kickstarter
									Campaign by Regression Analysis
								</h2>
								<p>
									This study quantifies the factors that may lead to a successful Kickstarter campaign. Using Kickstarter data and logit and linear probability models this analysis provides information on the factors that can increase the chance of a successful Kickstarter campaign. The factors included in this analysis include the type of campaign, posting date and time, funding goal, incentives, and other pieces making up Kickstarter campaigns. This research can provide concrete advice for those seeking to successfully fund a Kickstarter campaign.

								<h2>State Factors and Race on COVID-19 Deaths</h2>
								<p>
									This analysis is used to gain a better understanding of the factors affecting the spread of COVID-19. This project explores the effects of 7 explanatory variables on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the United States using multiple linear regression. These 7 variables were chosen as literature on the topic has tended to find that these, and similar variables, were often the most important factors in determining the risk of COVID-19 spread. Additionally, the number of deaths appears to be the most accurate predictor of COVID-19 spread in the United States. Finally, this analysis is also concerned in finding if there is a disproportionate amount of deaths by COVID-19 for minority groups in the United States.

									<h2>Assessing the Distribution of Bike Lanes Among Income Groups in New York City
									</h2>
									<p>
										This project assesses the growth of bike lanes throughout New York City from 1888 to 2019.
										By using a 3D representation produced in ArcGis this project begins to answer the question of if bike lanes,
										in their current state, are evenly distributed across New York City household income groups. Based on the findings
										I suggest improvements to be made in NYC bike infrastructure access.
